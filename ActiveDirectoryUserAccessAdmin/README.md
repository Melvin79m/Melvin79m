In this phase of the project, I expanded my existing MelTech.com Active Directory lab by designing a full enterprise-style OU hierarchy that reflects both organizational structure and physical layout. I created departmental OUs for Admins, HelpDesk, Interns, SystemAdmin, Networking, Security, HR, Executives, and Sales, along with a dedicated Admins OU for privileged accounts. To simulate a realistic building layout, I added four floor-level OUs—Floor 1 through Floor 4—and assigned each department to its corresponding floor: Interns and HelpDesk on Floor 1, SystemAdmin and Networking on Floor 2, Security and HR on Floor 3, and Executives and Sales on Floor 4. Within each department, I implemented sub-OUs for DayShift and NightShift to allow future GPOs and access-control rules to be applied based on shift schedules. This OU structure becomes the foundation for user provisioning, group management, GPO deployment, and delegated administration throughout the project.
