# Active Directory Home Lab Project

This project is the start of my personal IT home lab, where I’m gaining hands-on experience with **Windows Server 2022** and **Active Directory**.  

The goal is to build a small virtual network using **Oracle VirtualBox** to simulate a real-world business environment.

### Tools & Environment
- **Windows 11 ISO** – Client machine  
- **Windows Server 2022 ISO** – Domain Controller  
- **Oracle VirtualBox** – Virtual machine manager  

### Objectives
Through this lab, I am focusing on:  
- Setting up an **Active Directory Domain**  
- **User and group management**  
- **Group Policies**  
- **DNS and DHCP services**  

> **Note:** This is an ongoing project and I will continue adding more steps, screenshots, and documentation as I expand my lab.

## Step 1: Installing the ISOs in VirtualBox

I created two virtual machines in Oracle VirtualBox—one for **Windows Server 2022** and one for **Windows 11**. Each VM was set up using its respective ISO file. Windows Server 2022 will act as the domain controller, and Windows 11 will serve as the client machine.

## Step 2: Installing and Configuring Active Directory

Installed **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)** on Windows Server 2022 and promoted the server to a **Domain Controller**.  
- Created a new forest and domain: **MelTech.com**  
- Rebooted the server to apply changes

## Step 3: Installing Guest Additions and Creating Users

Installed **VirtualBox Guest Additions** on the Windows Server 2022 VM to enable folder sharing. Created **Active Directory users**:  
- Thomas C Anderson  
- Melvin L Williams

## Step 4: Network Configuration and Domain Connection

Configured network settings and connected the Windows 11 client to the domain:  
- Static IPs: Server `10.1.10.2`, Client `10.1.
