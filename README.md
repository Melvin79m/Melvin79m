## Hi, I'm Melvin Williams
Entry-Level IT Support & Service Desk Technician

I’m an entry-level IT Support professional with hands-on experience supporting Windows, Active Directory, and Microsoft 365 environments through structured home labs that mirror real-world help desk workflows. I focus on user support, authentication issues, access management, and troubleshooting common Tier 1 problems.

My long-term goal is network engineering, but my current focus is building strong fundamentals in IT support, identity, and networking by creating realistic environments, intentionally breaking things, fixing them, and documenting the process clearly.


## Projects

This repository is organized into four main sections, each documenting a different part of my hands-on IT and networking experience.


- **Microsoft 365 Help Desk Lab** — Simulated Tier 1 IT support environment focused on Microsoft 365 and Entra ID user provisioning, licensing, MFA troubleshooting, and common service desk tickets.

- **Active Directory Setup** — Building a Windows Server 2022 domain, users, OU structure, DNS, DHCP, and core Group Policy.

  - **Active Directory User & Access Administration Project** — Managing users, groups, permissions, roles, OU structure, department layouts, floors/shifts, GPOs, and real-world sysadmin workflows in a full enterprise-style environment.
