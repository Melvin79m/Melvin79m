## Hi there 👋

## Melvin Williams — IT Support Professional Focused on Network Engineering

I’m building a strong foundation in IT support while working toward a long-term career in network engineering. My approach is hands-on: I develop labs, break things on purpose, fix them, and document the process so I can learn and improve. This repository organizes my work across Active Directory, Azure, Networking, and Security, highlighting the areas I’m actively developing as I prepare for real-world IT environments.

## Projects

This repository is organized into four main sections, each documenting a different part of my hands-on IT and networking experience.

- **Active Directory Lab**  
  Setup of a Windows Server 2022 domain, users, Group Policy, permissions, and remote access.  
  [View Project](./ActiveDirectory/README.md)

- **Networking Lab**  
  IP addressing, routing, DHCP, DNS, NAT, VLANs, and troubleshooting fundamentals.  
  [View Project](./Networking/README.md)

- **Azure Lab**  
  Identity management, virtual machines, networking, and cloud resource administration.
