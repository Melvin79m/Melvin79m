## Hi there 👋

## Melvin Williams — IT Support Professional Focused on Network Engineering

I’m building a strong foundation in IT support while working toward a long-term career in network engineering. My approach is hands-on: I develop labs, break things on purpose, fix them, and document the process so I can learn and improve. This repository organizes my work across Active Directory, Azure, Networking, and Security, highlighting the areas I’m actively developing as I prepare for real-world IT environments.
